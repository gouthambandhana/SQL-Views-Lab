# Task 7: Creating Views  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
- Learn to create and use views.  
- Simplify complex queries by encapsulating them in views.  
- Use views for abstraction and security.  
- Understand reusable SQL logic.  

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench  

## ðŸ“œ Queries Included  
1. **Basic View Creation** â€“ Create a view from a simple `SELECT` query.  
2. **Complex View with Joins** â€“ Combine multiple tables into a single view.  
3. **Filtered View** â€“ Create a view that shows employees with salaries above a threshold.  
4. **Aggregated View** â€“ Create a view to show average salary by department.  
5. **Using Views in Queries** â€“ Query from a view just like a table.  
6. **Security with Views** â€“ Hide sensitive columns (e.g., salary details) by creating restricted views.
